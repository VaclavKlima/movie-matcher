# TODO

- Possibility to finish the matching (host will select which movie they will watch and it will end game)
- When the game ends, add an overview with statistics
- Add automatic flagging that a room ended when no one is using it (cron check)
- First movie match should appear after every player likes/dislikes at least 5 movies
- In the room matching instead of showing "ready" tag at player, show like/dislike ratio
